# IOS-Combine

**Combine** - is a declarative, reactive framework for processing asynchronous events over time.

Combine revolves around three main types: **publishers** to emit events over time, **operators** to asynchronously process and manipulate upstream events and **subscribers** to consume the results and do something useful with them.
